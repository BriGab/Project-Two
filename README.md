# MoJo

A mood based mediation journal designed to provide atmospheric inspiration for users to refresh their minds through free flow writing and reflection.

MoJo incorporates mood influenced backgrounds and optional prompts to ignite a users flow. This application provides a secure place to take a mental break from the world and hone in through acknowledging current emotional state and expressing freely. Upon arrival to MoJo landing page a user will be prompted to sign up or sign in, creating a safe space for users to have a free written meditative practice, knowing their journal entries are password protected. 

## How to use

Once securely logged in users have the opportunity to pick current mood and begin a journal session. The background color, brought in using Granim.js will help create an environment matching a users mood. For example a sad mood would bring in colors that represent and inspire that emotion. At that point a user can begin their flow of free writing, with an option of recieving a prompt for an extra spark to start.

Journal entries are saved for a user to view and edit later. The background shown while the journal post was written will come up when a user clicks on a past post. Users will also have the ability to go back and add comments on their previous posts allowing for deeper reflection. 

## Motivation
Coming together for project #2 we decided very quickly on running with this concept. As sort of a new age mood ring that challenges users to stop and take the time to debrief in the midst of our fast paced world it's something we all saw as being genuinely useful.

## Technology and Frameworks

* [Granim.js](https://sarcadass.github.io/granim.js/index.html)
* [ineedaprompt](https://ineedaprompt.com/)
* Node.js
* Express
* Sequelize
* Passport 
* Handlebars
* Materialize

Granim.js was our choice for new technology to incoporate in this project and is a huge part of the concept. A challenge that came along with Granim.js was not having the creative flexibility desired. Along with Granim.js we also used an API called ineedaprompt to bring in an optional prompt.
